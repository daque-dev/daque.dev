We are Daque. A team of two undergraduate students formed in mid-2018.

As we believe in open source, all our code is licensed under the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/){:target="_blank"}, and you can find it in our profiles at [GitHub](https://github.com/daque-dev){:target="_blank"} and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/daque){:target="_blank"}.

Our main project is [ViaRE](https://daque.me/viare), a procedurally generated game that tries to emulate the human existence, evolution, and interaction. It is inspired by complexity and chaos; emergence and selfâ€”organization; human history and evolution; and, briefly said: nature.

Along the road, we started developing [libdaque](https://code.dlang.org/packages/libdaque){:target="_blank"}, a Dlang package of procedural generation tools to help game developers in D.

Sometimes, we are in the mood to write about our processes, ideas, problems, and situations. You can read those things and some more at [our blog](https://daque.me/blog).
