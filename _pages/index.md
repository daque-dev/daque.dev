# Hi, we are Daque. We love procedural generation.

---

We are two students who try to keep developing interesting stuff in their free time. You may want to [read our blog](/blog), where we share our thoughts (mostly things related to math or programming).

Our main project is [ViaRE](/viare). A procedurally generated game that simulates human life in earth-like planets.

You can get to know who we are, what other things we do, what interests us, and some other stuff by [reading about us](/about). That would make us very happy.

You can reach us at [contact@daque.dev](mailto:contact@daque.dev).
