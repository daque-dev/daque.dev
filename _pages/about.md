We are Daque. A team of two undergraduate students formed in mid-2018.

Our real names are David and Miguel. Our usernames, **davidomarf** and **quevangel**. You see where **Daque** comes from? Pretty original, isn't it?

We are both studying Computer Engineering at the *Instituto PolitÃ©cnico Nacional*, in Mexico.

We met by some friends in common and we started to talk about programming. We were casual friends until we started to know a little bit more about the works of each other. Then we decided that we wanted to develop something together.

After several talks and chats, we set the idea of what would later be ViaRE.

Originally, we planned to write a game that would let you see the interactions between countries, and **inside** countries. Between cities, and **inside** cities. Between people, and **inside** people. And then, just appreciate how those interactions gave birth to order, patterns, and structures.

When we began the actual development stage, we started to focus on more and more tiny details â€”we are both somewhat of perfectionstsâ€”, and we are constantly changing what ViaRE will be â€”always for the better, that's for sureâ€”.

So, at the moment, we are not even close to what we imagine, but we are slowly building something that we both love. ðŸ™‚

Until then, we were David and Miguel working together. But in the following months we saw that we could make some other projects together. That, and the selfâ€”imposed pressure to follow some industry best practices and standards, made us create a GitLab group under the name Daque.

Ever since, we are *officially* Daque. And Daque is not just a development team, it's a great friendship.
